    <h1>Digital Citizenship</h1>
    
    <h2>What is Digital Citizenship?</h2>
    <p>Digital citizenship is the responsible, ethical, and safe use of technology and online spaces, involving respectful behavior, digital literacy, awareness of one's online footprint, and understanding rights and responsibilities in the digital world, much like being a good citizen in the physical world. It's about using tech to connect, learn, and create positively while avoiding harm to oneself or others, requiring empathy and critical thinking. </p>

    <h2>What is Digital Law?</h2>
    <p>Digital law (or cyber law) is the body of legal rules and principles governing activities, rights, and responsibilities in the digital world, regulating online behavior, data, technology use, and electronic transactions to address challenges like privacy, security, intellectual property, and cybercrime. It essentially covers what's legal and illegal online, applying real-world laws to the internet and digital environments. </p>

    <h2>What is AUP?</h2>
    <p>AUP most commonly stands for Acceptable Use Policy, a set of rules defining permitted and prohibited uses of an organization's network, devices, and data, ensuring security, compliance, and responsible behavior. It's a crucial document for companies, schools, and ISPs to set expectations for digital conduct, outlining rules for internet, email, and system access, with consequences for violations. Other less common meanings include Agile Unified Process (software development) or African Union Partnership (program). </p>

    <h2>What is Plagiarism?</h2>
    <p>Plagiarism is presenting someone else's words, ideas, or work as your own without giving proper credit, essentially stealing intellectual property and committing fraud, which can happen intentionally or accidentally. It's a serious ethical and academic violation, leading to penalties like failing grades, suspension, or even legal action if copyright is involved, and involves failing to cite sources for borrowed material, images, or data. </p>
