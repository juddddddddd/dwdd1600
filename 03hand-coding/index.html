        <h1>Your name</h1>
        <p><strong></strong>Your Name</strong>(Japanese: 君の名は。, Hepburn: <em>Kimi no Na wa</em>; lit:'Your Name is...') is a 2016 Japanese animated romantic fantasy film written and directed by Makoto Shinkai, produced by CoMix Wave Films, and distributed by Toho. The first installment of what critics deem Shinkai's "disaster trilogy"—followed by Weathering with You (2019) and Suzume (2022)—whose three entries each share themes inspired by the frequency of natural disasters in Japan, it depicts the story of high school students Taki Tachibana and Mitsuha Miyamizu, who suddenly begin to swap bodies despite having never met, unleashing chaos onto each other's lives.</p>
        <h2>How good it is</h2>
        <p>Your Name premièred at the 2016 Anime Expo in Los Angeles on July 3, 2016, and was theatrically released in Japan on August 26, 2016; it was released internationally by several distributors in 2017. The film received widespread critical acclaim, with praise for its story, animation, music, visuals, and emotional weight. Until it was surpassed by Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Movie: Mugen Train in 2020, Your Name was the highest-grossing Japanese film of all time, with a worldwide gross of US$400 million after re-release, breaking numerous box office records and dethroning Spirited Away. It received several accolades, including Best Animated Feature at the 2016 Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards, the 49th Sitges Film Festival, and the 71st Mainichi Film Awards; it was also nominated for the Japan Academy Film Prize for Animation of the Year.</p>
